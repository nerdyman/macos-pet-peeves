# macOS pet peeves

##  File Management

- Finder doesn't support cut (`cmd+x`) for files
- Save/Open dialogs never remember where you were last
- Save/Open dialog UI is all over the place and difficult to navigate
- Save/Open dialog doesn't support typing or editing the path, you have to use the dropdown or buttons
- Can't add plugins to Spotlight without disabling SIP
- Built in mouse buttons for forward and back don't work in Finder (but do in Chrome)
- Can't show hidden files without also showing exentsions on all files (e.g. now "Safari.app" is shown in Spotlight)

## UX

- Can't zoom scroll with mouse wheel in browsers
    - Only scrolling option zooms the entire screen
- Emoji Picker is sloooow and pastes the emoji where your cursor is - I want to copy it to my clipboard

## DX

- Can't set a default terminal emulator - it's always iterm

## Window Management

- No "Always on top" functionality to keep some windows above others
- Workspace auto switches when last window is closed
- Can't install customised window managers to resolve the keyboard & workspace issues without disabling security features
- Some windows have a 1px gap at the top showing the background between the window and the menu

## Keyboard Usage

- Tab navigation for dialogs is disabled by default
- No way to navigate Mission Control windows with the keyboard
- Cursor does not always follow when switching workspace or switching monitor with keyboard
- Delete key on external keyboard does not delete files in Finder
- Home/End keys on external keyboard need custom keybindings to work
- Can't switch to a different workspace on another monitor using the keyboard
- The UK layout sometimes messes up and switches `|` and `` ` `` but the keyboard manager thinks it's correct
    - Then need to use the terminal to delete the keyboard profiles because there's no way to do it in the UI
- There doesn't seem to be much logic around when a shortcut should be option and when it should be command

## Installing Apps

- App store is mostly useless - it doesn't even have basic apps like Google Chrome
- No built in package manager
- Need to use third party package managers (which are dope btw) or go to individual websites to download most software

## Hardware Support

- No way to disable scroll acceleration on external mice (Logitech G502 Hero in this case)
- Additional mouse buttons do not work out of the box and the third party logitech addon doesn't work either
- Rendering of the UI looks terrible on normal HD devices
    - Colors aren't as vibrant as they are on Linux and Windows
    - Fonts are blurry and font weights vary
    - Some colors e.g. bright red look like a bad quality JPEG
    - There was previously an option to change these settings per display but it has been removed in the latest release
- M1 macbook pro 
    - Only supports one external monitor
    - Only has two thunderbolt ports (and nothing else)
