    - Home/End keys on external keyboard need custom keybindings to work

- Rendering of the UI looks terrible on normal HD devices
    - Colors aren't as vibrant as they are on Linux and Windows
    - Fonts are blurry and font weights vary
    - Some colors e.g. bright red look like a bad quality JPEG
    - There was previously an option to change these settings per display but it has been removed in the latest release

    - App store is mostly useless - it doesn't even have basic apps like Google Chrome
    - No built in package manager (although Homebrew is awesome)
    - Need to go to individual websites to download some software
- M1 macbook pro only supports one external monitor
